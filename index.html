    <h2>About Me</h2>
    I'm eager to learn, evolve, and aquire new skills. With a background in
    Socioinformatics I looked at Machine Learning Algorithms with regards to
    their ethical viability.
    <br />
    As I have been working in Customer Support for several years, my
    communication between customers and development is one of my strong points.
